Analysing data and predicting temperatures given several atmospheric parameters in Barcelona using NASA's POWER server data. I obtained the data from the NASA POWER API from the website https://power.larc.nasa.gov/.

The work of the NASA POWER project is to provide solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.*from their website*

As said above, metereological information is of great importance for a variety of sectors of great impact for us a society. And with climate change, it is now more important than ever to understand and predict weather events.

In this project, I use Deep Neural Network and Random forest to predict temperatures. I also use PyTorch to create a Deep Neural Network.
